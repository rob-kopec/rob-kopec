# Hello, I'm Rob Kopec ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with 5 years of experience in full-stack development, specializing in Node.js, React, and Angular. I love building scalable, user-focused applications and have a solid background in DevOps, including CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform for infrastructure as code. I'm also a fan of Agile practices and collaborative problem-solving.

Currently, I'm diving into blockchain technology to broaden my skillset and explore decentralized solutions. This GitHub is where I share my projects, experiments, and learning journeyâ€”expect to see some exciting blockchain-based repos soon!

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Angular, JavaScript/TypeScript
Backend: Node.js, Express, Hapi
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform
Exploring: Blockchain (Solidity, Web3.js, etc.)
Feel free to check out my repos, contribute, or connect with me!
